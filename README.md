# brewpi
Docker container to run brewpi-script and brewpi-www

To use this container set and environment variable AVR which should be the address and port of the arduino/esp8266 e.g 192.168.0.25:23

The brewpi-script is using the legacy branch, this is because I am using an Arduino and esp8266 (as slick as the spark is, I am cheap).
